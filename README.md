## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I managed to get this solution done in less than 300 lines of styles. I am very happy with the outcome and I am certain that the solution slider will match perfectly! As mentioned in the introduction I used vanilla CSS to mix it up a bit so I am showing that I can use it and I‚Äôm not reliant on Sass. It was a bit of back and fourth, but splitting the editor views into two columns helped with this, so using vanilla CSS in the future is not out of the question.
